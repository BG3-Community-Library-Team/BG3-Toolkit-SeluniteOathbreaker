## Oathbreaker Paladin

Adds the Oathbreaker Paladin as a selectable subclass. This is a copy of the standard Oathbreaker subclass and has an additional Passive Toggle to enable/disable the Oathbreaker tag to help prevent soft-locking.

Ever wanted to play the oathbreaker durge of your dreams? Being consistent with the (paladin) canon past Sarevok throws at you? Or maybe you want to be a tragic Tav who have lost their way long before being abducted by the mindflayers? Well, no worries! Now you can begin the game as an oathbreaker, a paladin who denied and has broken their oath, for your various rp reasons, feature complete with class progression, matching starting gear and a TAG toggle (passives) that allows the player to both experience the cool class dialogues but also respec, should the player wish to.
Be sure to toggle the passive now included as a subclass feature and go nuts in dealing judgement and smites for what YOU believe in, oathbreaker.

> *"I wielded the powers of darkness, yet held a candle for those who needed the light...Good or ill, I made my choices."*  
> Oathbreaker Knight

### Author Notes:
- This mod will probably not spawn the oathbreaker knight. Bro is a cool npc but his appearance is tied to the oathbreaking mechanic implemented in the game.
- If a companion breaks their oath then the Oathbreaker knight should spawn as normal.
- ⚠️ If a character becomes an Oathbreaker the "traditional" way, they will still gain the toggle, however it will not remove the Oathbreaker tag. ⚠️

## Very Basic Symlink Details

- Each contents of the Toolkit folder should be Symlinked to your BG3 data folder.
- The default location will be `\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3\Data` which shouldn't be too difficult to find.
- These are the folders:
  - `Data\Editor\Mods\`
  - `Data\Mods\`
  - `Data\Projects\`
  - `Data\Public\`
- There are many ways to Symlink. I use [Link Shell Extension](https://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html).
